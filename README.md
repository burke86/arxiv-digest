I built this during my PhD in astronomy at Aarhus University to stay on top of new papers without doomscrolling arXiv. Others found it useful, so I made it public. It works for anyone whose papers are on arXiv — astronomy, physics, CS, whatever your field.

## Quick Start

Setup has three parts: make your own copy of the project, configure it for your research, and give it permission to send emails. The setup wizard handles the middle part — it generates a config file you just drop in.

**Step 1 — Fork the repo** (make your own copy of the project on GitHub)

Go to [github.com/SilkeDainese/arxiv-digest](https://github.com/SilkeDainese/arxiv-digest) and click **Fork** in the top right. This creates a private copy under your own GitHub account. Your config and data stay in your fork, separate from everyone else's.

**Step 2 — Run the setup wizard**

**[Open the setup wizard →](https://arxiv-digest-production-93ba.up.railway.app)**

Fill in your research interests — the wizard generates a `config.yaml` file for you. Download it, then upload it to the root of your fork (on GitHub: "Add file" → "Upload files" → drop `config.yaml` → "Commit changes").

**Step 3 — Add your secrets and start the automation**

Secrets are private settings stored inside your GitHub repository — like a password vault that GitHub Actions (GitHub's built-in automation — it runs your digest on a schedule, no server needed) can read but nobody else can see.

Go to your fork → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** and add these:

| Secret name | What to put there | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Your email address | Yes |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | A Google AI Studio API key for Gemini relevance scoring and structured summaries ([create one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)) | Recommended for this fork |
| `DIGEST_RELAY_TOKEN` | If you got an access code from a colleague: enter it in the setup wizard's Access Code button — the token appears automatically. No access code? Skip this row and use Option B (your own email) instead. | Option A |
| `SMTP_USER` + `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Your email address + an app password (a special one-time password your email provider generates so you don't expose your real password). **Gmail users:** You need 2-Step Verification enabled first — [enable it here](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification). Then [generate an app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). **Outlook users:** also add `smtp_server: "smtp.office365.com"` to your config.yaml. | Option B |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional for custom workflows; the main digest workflow does not pass this secret | Optional |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional upstream-compatible Claude fallback | Optional |

Finally, go to the **Actions** tab in your fork, enable workflows when prompted, then click **arXiv Digest → Run workflow** to send your first digest. After that, it runs automatically on the schedule you set.

> **That's it.** *This fork runs weekdays at 13:00 UTC (about 8 AM Eastern standard time / 9 AM Eastern daylight time). GitHub cron does not adjust for DST.*

<details>
<summary>Something not working?</summary>

- Make sure workflows are enabled — **Actions** tab → click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
- Secrets go in *your fork*, not the original repo
- The file must be named exactly `config.yaml` (not `config (1).yaml`) and sit in the repo root
- First run: use "Run workflow" manually to test — check the run log if no email arrives (Actions → click on the run → expand the steps)
- Outlook users: add `smtp_server: "smtp.office365.com"` to your `config.yaml`

## How Scoring Works

Every new arXiv paper in your categories gets scored before it reaches your inbox. The process has three layers:

```
Your interests → arXiv papers → Keyword match → AI re-ranking → Author boost → Your digest
```

**1. Keyword matching** — Each paper's title and abstract is compared against your keywords. Every keyword has a weight from 1 to 10. Matching is fuzzy: `planet` matches `planetary`, `atmospheric` matches `atmosphere`.

**2. AI re-ranking** — If you have an AI key, the system reads your free-text research description and re-ranks the keyword-filtered papers by actual relevance — not just term overlap. The more specific your description, the better. A paper about "M-dwarf flare rates" might score low on keywords but rank high if you wrote "I study how stellar activity affects atmospheric escape on rocky planets."

**3. Author boost** — Papers by people in your collaborator list get bumped up. Papers you authored get a dedicated celebration section.

If AI is unavailable, the system cascades automatically through fallback tiers:

| Tier | Provider | When it's used |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Gemini | This fork's main workflow passes `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| 2 | Other providers | Available in custom workflows if configured |
| 3 | Keywords only | Always — no key needed |

If one tier fails, the next takes over. You always get a digest. The AI keys are entirely optional — keyword scoring works well on its own, especially once you tune your keyword weights.

## Customising Your Digest

See [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) for all options with inline comments. Key fields:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `research_context` | Free-text description of your research — the more specific, the better |
| `keywords` | `keyword: weight` pairs (1–10) |
| `categories` | arXiv categories to monitor (e.g. `astro-ph.EP` for exoplanets) |
| `research_authors` | Authors whose papers get a relevance boost |
| `colleagues` | People whose papers always appear, even if off-topic |
| `digest_mode` | `highlights` (up to 6 papers, higher bar) or `in_depth` (up to 15, wider net) |
| `recipient_view_mode` | `deep_read` (full cards with context) or `5_min_skim` (top 3 one-liners) |
| `self_match` | Your name as it appears on arXiv — triggers a celebration section when you publish |

To change the schedule, edit the cron line in [`.github/workflows/digest.yml`](.github/workflows/digest.yml). This fork runs every weekday at 13:00 UTC; GitHub cron does not adjust for daylight saving time.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Do I need an API key?</summary>

No. Keyword scoring works without an AI key. For semantic ranking and concise scientific summaries in this fork, add a Google AI Studio API key as the `GEMINI_API_KEY` repository secret. The fork uses `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` by default; you can change `gemini_api_model` in `config.yaml`. Gemini's free tier has account-specific rate limits; check your limits in AI Studio. The main workflow does not pass `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I don't have an invite code / relay token?</summary>

You can send digests from your own email instead. Add `SMTP_USER` (your email address) and `SMTP_PASSWORD` (a Gmail or Outlook app password — a special password generated just for this, separate from your real one) as repository secrets.

- Gmail app password: [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
- Outlook users: also add `smtp_server: "smtp.office365.com"` to your `config.yaml`

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the feedback loop work?</summary>

Each paper card in the digest email has ↑ and ↓ arrows. Clicking one creates a GitHub issue in your fork (GitHub Issues is just a built-in note-taking system — the digest reads these notes on its next run). Upvoted keywords get a scoring boost, downvoted ones get dampened. The system learns what you actually care about over time.

To enable feedback arrows, set `github_repo: "yourusername/arxiv-digest"` in your `config.yaml`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I have an invite code — where do I enter it?</summary>

On the [setup wizard](https://arxiv-digest-production-93ba.up.railway.app), click the **Access code** button in the top-right corner. An invite code is a shortcut from a colleague who already runs the digest — it pre-fills your AI key and email relay settings so you don't have to configure them yourself.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I change the delivery schedule?</summary>

The setup wizard lets you pick Mon/Wed/Fri, every weekday, or weekly. That choice goes into your `config.yaml`.

The *actual* schedule is controlled by `.github/workflows/digest.yml`. This fork runs weekdays at 13:00 UTC, approximately 8 AM US Eastern in standard time and 9 AM during daylight time. GitHub cron schedules use UTC and do not automatically adjust for DST. Trigger a manual run any time: your repo → Actions → arXiv Digest → Run workflow.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I pause or unsubscribe?</summary>

- **Pause:** your repo → Actions → arXiv Digest → click `⋯` → Disable workflow
- **Delete everything:** your repo → Settings → scroll to Danger Zone → Delete this repository

Every digest email also includes self-service links at the bottom: edit interests, pause, re-run setup, delete.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I run it locally?</summary>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python digest.py --preview        # renders in browser, no email sent
python digest.py                  # full run (needs RECIPIENT_EMAIL + email credentials)
python setup/server.py            # run the setup wizard locally at localhost:8080
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use the terminal for setup?</summary>

Run `python -m scripts.friend_setup` from a checkout of this repo. It opens the setup wizard, waits for the downloaded config file, forks the repo, uploads the config, and enables GitHub Actions — all in one go.

## GCP Vertex AI Setup (maintainer only)

This section is for the repo owner running the digest with Vertex AI on GCP. Forkers using their own AI keys don't need this.

**One-time setup:**

1. Run the setup script from your local machine (requires `gcloud` CLI, authenticated to `silke-hub`):

   ```bash
   bash gcp-wif-setup.sh
   ```

   This creates a service account, a Workload Identity Pool, and a GitHub OIDC provider — no API keys involved.

2. The script prints two values at the end. Add them as **GitHub Actions variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab — not secrets, they contain no sensitive data):

   | Variable name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `WIF_PROVIDER` | `projects/932510967521/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider` |
   | `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | `arxiv-digest-runner@silke-hub.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |

3. That's it. GitHub Actions will authenticate to GCP automatically on every run. No API key needed, no rotation required.
